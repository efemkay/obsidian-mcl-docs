## Overview

This module (*direct link to snippet: [MCL Wide Views.css](https://github.com/efemkay/obsidian-modular-css-layout/blob/main/MCL%20Wide%20Views.css)*) provides you the option to expand your note's page or block (limited to dataview, table and/or callout blocks) to be wider than your define readable line width. This way certain contents can be given more "breathing space". See each features section below for more details on how to control that.

- **[[docs/01 Wide Views/02 Wide Page\|Wide Page]]**  #mcl/list-card

- **[[docs/01 Wide Views/03 Wide Blocks\|Wide Blocks]]** 
	- allow specific note to have specific block to be wider than the note's readable line length
