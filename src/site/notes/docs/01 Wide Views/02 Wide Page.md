## Overview

Wide Page layout will allow you to change a specific note to have full screen width even though readable line length (RLL) is enabled in the Obsidian settings.

To use it, add Properties `cssclasses` with value of `wide-page` on the specific note you want to have it enabled (see screenshot below). If you were to view in Source Mode, it will look something like markdown below.

```markdown
---
cssclasses: wide-page
---

<the rest of your note>
```
