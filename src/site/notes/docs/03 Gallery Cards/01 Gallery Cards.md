> CSS snippet file: [MCL Gallery Cards.css](https://github.com/efemkay/obsidian-modular-css-layout/blob/main/MCL%20Gallery%20Cards.css)

Gallery Cards CSS snippet will allow you to create image gallery and control image customisation (like rounded corner and max width). In summary this snippet will provide the following features:

- **[[docs/03 Gallery Cards/02-image-gallery\|Image Gallery]]**  #mcl/list-card
	- allow for multiple columns setup using either sub callouts or any of the acceptable markdown components
- **[[docs/03 Gallery Cards/04-image-float\|Float Image]]** 
	- create a floating image to either side of the screen (but still within readable line length) and allow text to flow around it
- **[[docs/03 Gallery Cards/03-image-control\|Image and Mermaid Control]]** 
	- Style settings options to change image / mermaid diagram default dimension and scales

---

- Image gallery using callout by specifying the callout-metadata `gallery` e.g. `> [!NOTE|gallery]`
- Image gallery using YAML/frontmatter .`cssClass: image-gallery`
- Image and Mermaid Diagram Controls
    - Dimension control for images in bullet list
