## Overview

Float Callout will allow you to position side note or info box either to the left or right of the main note with other content wrapping around it. It uses callout-metadata to specify which side to float to and the size of the callout

### How To Use / Basic Syntax

1. Add `left` or `right` to the callout-metadata e.g. `[!info|right]`
2. Make sure the callout is above the paragraph that you want to have it wrapped around

Here is an example markdown

```markdown
### Main Article

> [!info|left]
> Addition note to the main article

Content of the main article
```

> Basic syntax will apply to Reading View. To make it work with Live Preview see Additional Controls below


## Additional Controls

### Adjust Width Definition

By default, the width of the callout will dynamically follow the content. You can make it fixed width by specifying the width option. There are 3 width option:

- `-small` - default width 300px
- `-medium` - default width 400px
- `-large` - default width 600px

Here's an example markdown

```markdown
## Main Article

> [!info|left-medium]
> Addition note to the main article

Content of the main article
```

### Apply to Live Preview

By default, if you only specify either left or right, Float Callout will only work in Reading View. If you want it to also work in Live Preview, prepend `float-` before the `left` or `right` e.g. `[!info|float-right]`

Here's an example markdown

```markdown
## Main Article

> [!info|float-left]
> Addition note to the main article

Content of the main article
```

> **Note on Editing in Live Preview**
>
> In previous version of Float Image, editing text next to it was quite janky. I've improved it a bit (for `float-right` at least). For `float-left` you may still find selecting and navigating the text (up and down) still not possible.
>
> To edit, it's better to navigate using keyboard (from the top or bottom) instead of mouse/trackpad. Even better, use Source Mode to edit.


### Combining the Additional Controls

You can also combine the above controls together. Here's an example markdown

```markdown
## Main Article

> [!info|float-left-medium]
> Addition note to the main article

Content of the main article
```

### Additional Global Settings via Style Settings

If you have Style Settings plugin installed, you may control the following aspects (go to `Style Settings > Modular CSS Layout - Multi Column > Float Callout`)
- Hide / Show SNW Indicator in Float Callout
- Adjust width definition for "small", "medium", and "large"
- Adjust margin top for Float Callout

> >> Switzerlandâ€™s weather in January is dominated by cold temperatures and snowfall.
>
> - ### The best months to ski in Switzerland are December, January, and February with **January would be the best month** to ski in Switzerland of all three.
> 	- Most tourists who intend to ski tend to visit **between Christmas and New Year**. Lots of locals go skiing during this period as well.
> 	- **January** is the best month to ski in my opinion. Snow conditions are often good, there are fewer crowds and hotel prices are not as high.
> 	- During **February**, it is common for locals to take ski vacations. If you go during this time, expect more crowds and higher hotel prices.
