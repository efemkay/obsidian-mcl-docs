## Overview

List Card layout will allow you to create multi column and multi row layout using a combination of (a) unordered lists (i.e.  `- list item`) and (b) custom hashtag at the specific list block.

### How to Use `#mcl/list-card`

Technically List Card is quite similar to List Grid but with extra customisation to make it card like. In order to enable it, place the hashtag anywhere in the top-level list items (preferably in the first bullet for easy identification). There are two options for List Card i.e.
- `#mcl/list-card` - default minimum width 250px
- `#mcl/list-card-wide` - default minimum width 350px

If you have consecutive group of list that you actually meant to be a separate lists, ensure to properly "break" it by placing either a header, horizontal line or `<br/>` tag in between

> This option require your Obsidian to be installed with installer version 1.1.9 or higher (note that there are installer and app versions).

Here's an example markdown:
```md
- #### Core Work #mcl/list-card
    - [[00 Home|Main Goal 1]]
    - [[00 Home|Main Goal 1]]
    - [[00 Home|Main Goal 1]]
        - Collaboration with Jane
    - [[00 Home|Main Goal 1]]
- #### Learning & System
    - [[00 Home|Learning Goal 1]]
    - [[00 Home|Initiative 1]]
    - [[00 Home|Initiative 2]]
- #### Personal
    - [[00 Home|Personal Goal 1]]
    - [[00 Home|Personal Goal 2]]
```

> The number of cards can appear per row is subject to card's minimum width and note's width. Card's minimum width is adjustable via Style Settings plugin.

## Additional Controls
If you have Style Settings plugin installed, you may control the following aspects (go to `Style Settings > Modular CSS Layout - Multi Column > List Grid and List Card`)
- Card's width and background Color
- Cards' border width and border color
- Gap between card
- Bottom border for the first header in the card
