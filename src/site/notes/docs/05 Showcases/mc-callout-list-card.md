## When is the best to ski in Switzerland?

> [!multi-column]
>
> > [!blank|wide-3]
> > - ### **The best months to ski** in Switzerland are **December, January, and February** with **January would be the best month to ski in Switzerland** of all three.
> > 	- Most tourists who intend to ski tend to visit **between Christmas and New Year**. Lots of locals go skiing during this period as well.
> > 	- **January** is the best month to ski in my opinion. Snow conditions are often good, there are fewer crowds and hotel prices are not as high.
> > 	- During **February**, it is common for locals to take ski vacations. If you go during this time, expect more crowds and higher hotel prices.
